**Hurray, you did it ! üëè**

### Some template for import intents/entities?

Yeah, there is in the folder `Templates`

But, really, go to the documentation to know how to construct your [Intents](https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/api-v2/rest/Shared.Types/Intent) and [Entities](https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/api-v2/rest/Shared.Types/BatchUpdateEntityTypesResponse#EntityType)

The best way to learn is still to analyze a file containing one of your entities or your intents that you have exported with this tool.

### This tool is in french ?!

Yeah, but you have all elements in this README for know how this tool work.
